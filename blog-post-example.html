                    <p>When you think of Turkish cuisine, rich kebabs and milky desserts might come to mind. But Istanbul is a paradise for vegans if you know where to look! As a local who has been plant-based for years, I'm here to guide you through the city's incredible vegan offerings.</p>
                    
                    <h2>1. Start Your Day with a Vegan "Serpme Kahvaltı"</h2>
                    <p>Yes, the famous Turkish breakfast spread can be vegan! Many modern cafes in neighborhoods like Cihangir and Moda now offer fully vegan versions. Imagine tables filled with different types of olives, fresh jams, vegan cheeses made from cashews, "acuka" (a spicy tomato-walnut spread), and freshly baked "simit".</p>

                        <h4>Taste It Yourself!</h4>
                        <p>Want to experience Istanbul's best vegan breakfast spots with a local? We can add it to your personalized journey!</p>

                    </div>

                    <h2>2. Don't Miss "Çiğ Köfte"</h2>
                    <p>This is a naturally vegan street food hero! Traditionally made with raw meat, the version you'll find everywhere today is made from bulgur, spices, and tomato paste. It's spicy, satisfying, and served in a lavaş wrap with fresh greens. A must-try!</p>

                    <h3>Where to find the best Çiğ Köfte?</h3>
                    <p>While there are many chains, the small, independent shops in the backstreets of Kadıköy or Beşiktaş often have the most flavourful versions. Ask your local guide to show you their favorite spot!</p>
