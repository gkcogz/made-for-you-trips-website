Cappadocia is world-famous for its magical hot air balloon rides over a fairy-tale landscape. But to truly connect with this unique region, you need to put on your hiking boots and explore its valleys on foot.

## Rose Valley (Güllüdere)
Perfect for sunset hikes, the Rose Valley gets its name from the pinkish hue the rock formations take on as the sun goes down. The trails are relatively easy and offer breathtaking views. You'll stumble upon ancient cave churches and pigeon houses carved into the rock.
